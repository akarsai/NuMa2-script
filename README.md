# Numerical Mathematics 2 script
A script of the Numerical Mathematics 2 lecture held by K. Fackeldey.

Unfortunately, some parts of chapter 1 are missing. I will add them at some point.

If something is wrong, you can message me at a.karsai@campus.tu-berlin.de or correct it in the .tex code and commit.
